About Me
========

I am a skilled and dedicated technology worker with a mind for technical challenges
and a focus on software build and deployment automation. I have a keen interest in improving processes and products by leveraging existing tools and adopting new technologies.

Experience
==========

Software Build & Configuration Management
-----------------------------------------
  
  Navtech Inc. *April 2011 - Present*

The Build team focuses on the administration and automation of software repositories and releases acting as the gatekeepers between development, quality assurance and production.

As a build team member I helped migrate the build systems from a home-grown solution to the open source Jenkins continuous integration system. As part of this effort I implemented integration between Jenkins and our issue tracking system by writing a Jenkins plugin and extending the issue tracker link builds and issues together.

Day to day responsibilities include

* support for global development infrastructure
* scripting in Python, Perl, and shell to improve the build infrastructure
* QA environment configuration and support
* Document product updates and procedures

Installation Management Specialist
----------------------------------
  
  Navtech Inc. *June 2008 - April 2011*

As an installation management specialist I was responsible for the configuration, documentation, customisation and support of production systems for the company and its customers. As a third-tier support role I was in constant contact with technical support, customers, developers, and IT to help satisfy customer requirements.

This role provided the foundation for my knowledge in Linux and Windows configuration management. It was in this position I first started looking at better ways to implement and maintain consistent configurations which I am now able to implement in my build role.

While on the installation management team I desgined a practical skills exam for potential hires to the technical support role. I used virtual machines and snapshots to set up the problems that needed to be solved and session recording to help evaluate the candidates.

Technical Support Specialist
----------------------------
  
  Navtech Inc. *February 2007 - June 2008*

This second-tier support role is where I first got to apply the knowledge I gained from playing with Linux in my spare time and solve real problems with it. I learned how to handle high-pressure situations, prioritize issues when there were too many to keep up with, and productively use idle time when it was not required by customers.

Customer Service Representative
-------------------------------
  Virtek Vision. *2003 - 2007*

At Virtek I specialized in laser based two-dimensional measurement systems and provided installation, end user training, maintenance and support both on-site and remotely to customers all over North America and Europe. While there I developed a tool in Python that helped me analyse calibration data to find common issues more quickly.
